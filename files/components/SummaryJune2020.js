                                        Over the past three years, Project Break The Cycle stopped external fundraising and focused 
                                        on internal corporate matching fundraising as well as restructuring our primary fundraising 
                                        mechanism. We wanted to address ways of establishing organizational sustainability and 
                                        ease-of-use for our nonprofit partners. 
                                    </p>

                                        From the launch of the Orphan Children Scholarship Fund campaign in partnership with the 
                                        Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare until now, we have raised a combined $16,631 in profits 
                                        and donations! We are ecstatic to have such an amazing group of supporters sharing our 
                                        vision of breaking the cycles of injustice around the world. As of June 1, 2020, Project 
                                        Break The Cycle has dispersed $3,000 of the total amount. We will be dispersing the 
                                        remaining $13,631 physically within the next two months, as hyperinflation of the 
                                        Lebanese currency renders international bank transfers useless. We will be providing 
                                        receipts and more information when the time comes!

                                        We are excited to be relaunching externally in the month of July! Be on the lookout

                                        forward! We’re excited to have you on the journey with us!
