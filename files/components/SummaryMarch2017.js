                                         December 26, 2016, www.projectbreakthecycle.com was launched for the first time. 
                                         Over the past three months, over 2,000 people have accessed our website to learn 
                                         more about the cycle of childhood poverty, help support us, or even both. It’s 
                                         a privilege to have the support of over 2,000 individuals within the first three 
                                         months of our founding.

                                        On February 5, 2017, we launched the first part of our charity clothing line where 
                                        100% of profits went directly to our Orphan Children Scholarship Fund, in partnership 
                                        with the Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare. Part 1 included a hooded sweatshirt with 
                                        a unique cherry blossom embroidery, crafted from premium cotton and soft inner 
                                        linings. In addition, the cherry blossom embroidery on the upper chest held great 
                                        significance. Not only was it a beautiful piece of nature, but it also represented 
                                        fragility as it blooms for approximately only 14 days in the entire year. Just like 
                                        the blossoming, we must never take our lives for granted. Many are living in 
                                        conditions far worse than us, and it’s our duty to make the world a better place.

                                        Not only did we launch a clothing line, but we also worked with businesses to establish 
                                        relationships that would help us along our mission. Although we officially launched only 
                                        three months ago, PBTC still has work to do. However, we were able to work with Amazon 
                                        and integrate our organization into their Amazon Smile program. If you shop on Amazon.com, 
                                        be sure to take a look at our Corporate Relations page and sign up for free! A portion of
                                        your purchases can go directly to Project Break The Cycle at no extra cost every time you 
                                        purchase something! Setup takes only 1-2 minutes. You can learn about our other corporate

                                        Together, as of March 29, 2017, we have raised $2,128.81 for our campaign in partnership 
                                        with the Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare. These funds will directly go towards providing 
                                        resources for the children of HTSW, including private education, books, school supplies, 
                                        and more. This was all possible with your help - so please keep supporting our shared goals!
