                    <p className="causes__text">
                    Yemen is going through the largest humanitarian crisis in human history. We partnered with the
                    Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation (YRRF) to give farm animals like chickens and goats
                    to poor and vulnerable families in Yemen. By donating farm animals, we want to help these families
                    have a consistent, sustainable source of food and income. Families can consume eggs and milk, sell
                    what products they have left over, and even breed their animals to grow their farms in the long term.

                                    In October 2020, we donated 500 chickens to 100 families (primarily woman-led households)
                                    in a village called Kaedenah in Hajjah Governorate, Yemen. Each family received 4 egg-laying 
                                    hens and 1 rooster, which allows families to breed chickens. The total cost for the project was 
                                    $2,360USD. These chickens can eat left over food or grains in the area, and donâ€™t need special feed.
